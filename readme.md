# What's this?

Here we document the methods for assembling and analysing version 3 of the *Pochonia chlamydosporia* strain 123 genome sequence.

This genome sequence assembly has been deposited in GenBank here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000411695.3 and in BioProject PRJNA68669 here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA68669/.

# Genome assembly of *Pochonia chlamydosporia* strain 123
We previously generated the version-2 draft genome assembly based only on short (Illumina sequence reads) as described in [this manuscript](10.1016/j.fgb.2014.02.002) and [this manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.15408).
